# Flavion Project: Culinary Ingredient Explorer

## Overview

The Culinary Ingredient Explorer is a web app for food lovers to browse, explore, and add to a growing list of ingredients and their flavor profiles. It lets users dive into ingredient details, discover flavor pairings, and manage ingredient entries.

## Features

### Ingredients List

Browse a full list of ingredients, complete with names, flavor tags, and easy-to-see background colors. You can scroll to see more and get inspired for your cooking adventures.

### Ingredient Details with Flavor Pairing Suggestions

Click on an ingredient to see more details like its picture, name, flavor tags, and suggested pairings. A "Back" link helps you return to the main list easily.

### Add Ingredient with Flavor Profile

Share your culinary discoveries by adding new ingredients and their flavor profiles through a dropdown form. The form has validation for mandatory fields and placeholder image logic. Successfully added ingredients appear at the top of the list.

### Delete Ingredient

Keep the list accurate by removing ingredients. Each ingredientâ€™s details page has a "Delete" button that comes with a confirmation dialog to prevent mistakes.

### Edit Ingredient

Correct any inaccuracies by editing ingredient details. An "Edit" link on the details page opens a form to modify information, with options to save or cancel changes.

### Add New Ingredient Form as Pop-up

For a better user experience, add and edit ingredients using a pop-up form that centers on the screen with a dimmed background. You can close the form by clicking outside it or submit to update the content.

### Filter Ingredients by Flavors

Filter ingredients by their flavor profiles to find matching ingredients easily. A "Flavor" filter section at the top of the list includes buttons for each flavor tag, with only one filter active at a time.

### Navigation

Navigate easily between pages using a persistent navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. It includes links to "Ingredients" and "Pairings," with visual highlighting for the active page.
